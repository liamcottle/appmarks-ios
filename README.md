Appmarks is an iOS app developed with SwiftUI that lets you bookmark apps from the AppStore.

I've been wanting to learn to develop iOS apps with SwiftUI, but hadn't been able to come up with any ideas for a starter project. After coming across [this tweet reply](https://twitter.com/j_holtslander/status/1355273816847437831) I decided this is what I would build.

I'm completely new to Swift and SwiftUI, (coming from a Java/PHP/ObjC background), so if I'm doing something wrong, feel free to let me know!
